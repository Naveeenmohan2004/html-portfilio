<h2>Top Three Movies Of All The Time</h2>
<h3>Vettaiyadu Vilaiyadu</h3>
<p>In 2005, Gautham Vasudev Menon planned to make a film in Malayalam<br/>(which eventually became Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu) and approached Mohanlal after finishing the script, but nothing materialised.[7] Kamal Haasan had agreed to make a film for producer Kaja Mohideen of Roja Combines, and the pair discussed signing Menon to be the director after they were impressed with his work in Kaakha Kaakha (2003). Initially, Haasan narrated the script of Dasavathaaram (2008) to Menon and asked him to direct it, but the latter rejected it. Later, Menon discussed the script of Pachaikili Muthucharam (2007) with Haasan, and the actor asked him to develop it into a script within forty days. However, he later had second thoughts and asked Menon for a different script to collaborate on. Menon was keen to make a trilogy of police films, much like Ram Gopal Varma's gangster trilogy, and subsequently planned Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu as the second in the series after Kaakha Kaakha. </p>
<h3>Bonbay</h3>
<p>Begins like a silly Indian love/dance movie and develops into the strongest</p><p>most emotional movie I have ever seen. I saw it in the Gothenburg film festival and I saw couples holding each other after the film finished (comforting each other) and a guy asked: " Do they have a crisis center set up to help us deal with the movie now?". Religious tensions and human conflicts is a hard subject (doing the right vs the wrong thing), wonderfully dealt with in this movie. A strong argument for peace and a colorful tale of recent Indian history. See it.</p>
<h3>Varnam aayiram</h3>
<P>This movie was well made with nice melodious songs</P><p>What I really like about this movie was that it showed how fathers are important as well. Most movies always talk about mother as the motivation and somehow portray the dad as military style attitude or just thrown in for show but this movie was all about a dad's motivation, a dad who was living and compassionate. As for the actors: They really created magic with this movie. Surya was amazing. He really dug into the characters' role equally. His expressions and flawless Hindi and Tamil made this movie very enjoyable as well as his dual role. His attitude kept changing so it held the audience's eyes. Sameera Reddy was also wonderful. Despite the limited screen time, she really made a strong impact. Simran was also great. It has been a long time since I have seen her and her presence made the movie pleasant. Divya Spandana was not bad at all. I felt that she was thrown in but there needed to be something to make the movie going. The songs were very nice and melodious. Although it was not very fast paced, the creative sounds made it worthwhile. Only negative thought: I really wished that there were subtitles so that we could understand what Hindi words were spoken. Overall, this movie had a little bit of everything: love, violence, adventure, music and it is a definite must watch</P>
